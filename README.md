## 📌 Project Summaries

### 📊 Project 1 — Bayes Decision Theory with Gaussian Distributions

**Objective**: Build a Bayes classifier for two medical diagnostic classes using Gaussian probability density functions.  
**Scenario**: You’re a data engineer in a diagnostic center tasked with supporting medical decisions using lab data.  
**Key Concepts**:
- Class-conditional PDFs: N(μ₁, Σ₁), N(μ₂, Σ₂)
- Posterior probabilities and decision boundaries
- Bayes error computation

### 📈 Project 2 — Maximum Likelihood vs Bayesian Estimation

**Objective**: Compare Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Bayesian estimation for classifying user stress based on gamepad pressure metrics.  
**Scenario**: You work in a game development company analyzing stress levels in gamers based on button-press data.  
**Key Concepts**:
- MLE for parameter estimation with Cauchy distributions
- Bayesian posterior using a heavy-tailed prior
- Log-likelihood curves and posterior PDFs
- Discriminant functions g(x) and h(x)

### 🌳 Project 3 — Decision Trees & Random Forests (Iris Dataset)

**Objective**: Apply and compare Decision Trees and Random Forests for classifying Iris flower species using sklearn.  
**Scenario**: You are a data analyst in a botany lab working on automating iris species recognition.  
**Key Concepts**:
- DecisionTreeClassifier and contour plots of decision boundaries
- Manual implementation of Bootstrapped Random Forests
- Effect of tree depth and bootstrap ratio (γ) on classification accuracy
